    message: |
      Use modern '@use' directive instead of deprecated '@import' for SCSS modules.

      @import is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.

      Before: @import 'styles/colors';
      After:  @use "../../styles/colors" as *;

      Benefits:
      - Explicit namespacing prevents variable collisions
      - Files loaded once (vs @import loads multiple times)
      - Better tree-shaking for smaller bundles
